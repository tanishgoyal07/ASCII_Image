# ASCII STUDIO

Ascii Studio is a mobile application developed using the flutter framework which enables users to convert any image to ASCII art.

The user can either upload the image directly or can enter the text of which they wish to convert the image to ASCII art.


The app has been made with the idea of an old school theme in mind, where the background is kept black with text being neon in color also relating to the theme of the basic terminal.

The UI has been kept as minimal as possible relating to the fact that the pre-2000 websites and applications were mostly based on Web 1.0, where users could only read and write.

The whole development process was done keeping in mind the idea of the Old School Applications Theme and with the intention of making users nostalgic. Hope you like it.
